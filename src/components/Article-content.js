        content: `Security providers suggest that levels of spam traffic are falling, but that the UK is still a key target for email traffic. Symantec reported that globally, spam fell from 75 per cent of all email in 2011 to 69 per cent in 2012. Other sources (for example, CISCO, 2013) have also reported declines in the levels of spam globally. McAfee and others reported pharmaceutical spam as the most common type in circulation both in the UK and globally.

        Spam is generally considered a high-volume but low-impact threat, especially as many email providers automatically filter spam. It is of more concern in cases where users have pay-as-you-go or capped data tariffs, and the downloading of spam is consequently eating into their allowance, but it may be a particular threat if it is being used maliciously to send phishing emails or malware.
        
        Distributed denial of service attacks
        
        Limited industry data available suggest that the UK is not a key target for distributed denial of service attacks. Kaspersky reported that the UK was subject to less than four per cent of total DDoS attacks globally. Globally, online shopping sites were the most common targets for DDoS attacks, along with banks, stock exchanges, and gaming sites.
        
        Some small-scale surveys of businesses give evidence of experiences of DDoS attacks, although the self-selecting nature of these surveys means that the inferences that can be drawn from them are limited. For example, a DDoS protection provider called Neustar found that in a survey of 381 businesses, 22 per cent had experienced a disruptive DDoS attack in 2012. The largest proportions of respondents experiencing attacks were from the telecommunications, internet/e-commerce and online retail sectors. Over one-third of all DDoS attacks reported in the survey lasted over 24 hours.`
